   | `bar` dropped here while still borrowed
   | borrow might be used here, when `enforce_unique_lifetime` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `icell::generative::EnforceUniqueLifetime`

   = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
   = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
